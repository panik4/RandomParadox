# RandomParadox
A project to generate random scenarios for multiple Paradox Games.
As of now, only Hearts of Iron IV is supported.
The Hearts of Iron IV module generates a full mod on a randomly generated worldmap, with random countries, flags, national focus trees, unit templates.


Furthermore, this tool can be used as a map tool for total conversions, generating all relevant image and text files from a given heightmap. Building upon these files allows a far quicker start for total map conversion mods.
For example, giving the map of a fantasy world as input, and tweaking parameters for latitude and longitude, both the Bitmaps and texture files required for the mod will be generated.
While the resulting climate will not be exactly like the fantasy world, the maps can be altered from there on.

Detailed documentation on its use, with visual guides, is in the RandomParadox_Documentation.pdf.
