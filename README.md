# RandomParadox
A project to generate random scenarios for multiple Paradox Games.
This tool can be used as a map tool for total conversions, generating all relevant image and text files from given inputs, while being able to also randomize parts without inputs, or even generate fully random worlds.
Building upon these files allows a far quicker start for total map conversion mods.
For example, giving the map of a fantasy world as input, and tweaking parameters for latitude and longitude, the image, texture and text files required for the mod will be generated.

As of now, only Hearts of Iron IV is fully supported.

Victoria 3 and Europa Universalis 4 generation are creating loadable mods, but the map data isn't fully correct yet.

The Hearts of Iron IV module generates a full mod on a randomly generated worldmap, with random countries, flags, national focus trees, unit templates.

Note that the underlying world map generation is done in a separate project and repository "FastWorldGenerator", which is not yet open source.

It contains a simple GUI built using Dear Imgui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)


![worldmap](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/worldMap.png?raw=true)
A generated fully random world map.

![heightmap](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/heightmap.png?raw=true)
An example of a generated heightmap. The underlying world generation uses a system of using multiple configurable noise layers to create heightmaps. The noise layers themselves are generated by the FastNoiseLite library. (https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite).

![elevationTypes](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/elevationTypes.png?raw=true)
An example of the classification of elevation types, from mountains to valleys to plains.

![segments](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/segments.png?raw=true)
A visualisation of generated segments. Segments are created to represent regions of the world, taking elevation and climate features into account for their shape.

![provinces](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/provinces.png?raw=true)
A visualisation of generated provinces. A province map contains unique colour combinations for every province, while sharing a basic shade with the segment they stem from.

![regions](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/regions.png?raw=true)
A visualisation of generated regions. A province map contains unique colour combinations for every region.

![climate](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/climate.png?raw=true)
The visualisation of generated climate zones.

![treecoverage](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/trees.png?raw=true)
The visualisation of tree coverage overlayed over climate zones.

There are even more files and images being generated, which will not be displayed in the readme.

## Inputs
A variety of steps of the generation can take inputs from the user. Examples of using this are:
![terrainComplexInput](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/terrain-complexInput.png?raw=true)
An input for land forms/elevation types, which the tool the uses to produce a realistic heightmap.

![terrainComplexOutput](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/terrain-complexInputResult.png?raw=true)
The result of the input given above, with both the auto-detected elevation types and the generated heightmap.

![worldmapFromInput](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/worldMapFromSimple.png?raw=true)
A generated fully random world map.

![climateInput](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/climateClassification.png?raw=true)
Loading a climate map and labelling its colours to the tools climate zones


## Hoi4 Module
![ingamenc](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/hoi4/hoi4IngameNoCountries.png?raw=true)
A map based off of a simple input in-game without generated countries
![ingame](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/hoi4/hoi4Ingame.png?raw=true)
A map based off of a simple input in-game with generated countries
![terrain](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/hoi4/terrain.png?raw=true)
The terrain bitmap required by Hearts of Iron, with the correct colour codes. Note that the game interprets these colours to represent prettier colours in game.
![world_normal](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/hoi4/world_normal.png?raw=true)
The world normal map, generated with a Sobel Filter from the heightmap. The game uses this image to display mountains in game.
The river map, used by the game for placement of forest and jungles on continents.



## Victoria 3 Module
The tool can also generate Victoria 3 mods. This is still experimental, as some map features are not yet generated. However, visual terrain and provinces, states, regions, countries and more can already be generated.
![ingamevic3nc](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/vic3/vic3Map.png?raw=true)
A fully random map in-game

## General Note
Detailed documentation on its use, with visual guides, is in the RandomParadox_Documentation.pdf.
