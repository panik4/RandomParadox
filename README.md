# RandomParadox
A project to generate random scenarios for multiple Paradox Games.
As of now, only Hearts of Iron IV is supported.
Victoria 3 and Europa Universalis 4 generation are creating loadable mods, but the map data isn't fully correct yet.

Note that the underlying world map generation is done in a separate project and repository "FastWorldGenerator", which is not yet open source.

It contains a simple GUI built using Dear Imgui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

The Hearts of Iron IV module generates a full mod on a randomly generated worldmap, with random countries, flags, national focus trees, unit templates.
![worldmap](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/worldmap.png?raw=true)(https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite).
![heightmap](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/heightmap.png?raw=true)
An example of a generated heightmap. The underlying world generation uses a system of using mutliple configurable noise layers to create heightmaps. The noise layers themselves are generated by the FastNoiseLite library 

![provinces](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/provinces.PNG?raw=true)
An example of a generated province map. A province map contains unique colour combinations for every province.
![climate](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/climate.PNG?raw=true)
The generated climate map, which is converted to the colormap_rgb_cityemissivemask_a.dds texture required by the game.
![rivers](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/rivers.PNG?raw=true)
Generated river map.
![terrain](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/terrainHoi4.png?raw=true)
The terrain bitmap required by Hearts of Iron, with the correct colour codes. Note that the game interprets these colours to represent prettier colours in game.
![world_normal](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/sobelMap.PNG?raw=true)
The world normal map, generated with a Sobel Filter from the heightmap. The game uses this image to display mountains in game.
![rivers](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/trees.PNG?raw=true)
The river map, used by the game for placement of forest and jungles on continents.
There are even more files and images being generated, which will not be displayed in the readme.

Furthermore, the tool supports a cutting and scaling mode as of version 0.2.0, which allows configuring areas of given maps to cut out and scale.
Example of cutting out Indonesia from the base game files of Hearts of Iron IV and upscaling it to the default 5632*2048 resolution:
![indon_cut](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/0.6/ingameCut.PNG?raw=true)

Furthermore, this tool can be used as a map tool for total conversions, generating all relevant image and text files from a given heightmap. Building upon these files allows a far quicker start for total map conversion mods.
For example, giving the map of a fantasy world as input, and tweaking parameters for latitude and longitude, both the Bitmaps and texture files required for the mod will be generated.
While the resulting climate will not be exactly like the fantasy world, the maps can be altered from there on.
An example of a heightmap as input:
![japan_generated](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/japan_generated.png?raw=true)
and in-game:
![japan_generated_ingame](https://github.com/panik4/RandomParadox/blob/main/images/japan_generated_ingame.jpg?raw=true)

Detailed documentation on its use, with visual guides, is in the RandomParadox_Documentation.pdf.
