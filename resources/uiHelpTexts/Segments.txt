Segments define the areas, in which provinces are generated. This tab allows generating and loading them.
This divides the world into regions that are later used for province generation, and for states in the scenario modules for the generated games. If you want to input a map of states, you can do that here, and the provinces will be generated inside the borders of these segments. This process might take a while!

Loading segments/states:
Please be aware that segment inputs must be solid colours. This means that you don't draw in borders, but you draw areas which will be a segment, and in which provinces will be placed, staying inside these areas.
**When loading segments, please be aware that the tool will notify you of errors, where segments cross land/sea borders. It is recommended to fix this in the input file!**
To see where it doesn't match, a debug image will be visualised in the tool. You can also find this image in the Maps/errors folder, called segmentErrors.png. 
Purple means water is part of a majority land supersegment, and red means land is part of a majority sea segment.

** Do not forget that you can find the autogenerated segments map in the "Maps" folder next to the executable, in case you want to modify them and then load them back in again.**
