Segments define the areas, in which provinces are generated. This tab allows generating and loading them.
This divides the world into regions that are later used for province generation, and for states in the scenario modules for the generated games. If you want to input a map of states, you can do that here, and the provinces will be generated inside the borders of these segments. This process might take a while!
