Configure:
Set the paths to your game and mod folders. Only if validation succeeds can you continue.
The tool automatically searches for these folder on startup at standard locations.
	- Mod Name can be set to anything you like.
	- Game Path is where the game is installed, some files are read from there.
	- Mods Directory is where the games are looking for the descriptor files. This is usually something like C:\Users\user\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod
	- Mod Path is where the mods files will be written to, the descriptor put into the mod directory will point there so the mod can be found by the game. This can be ANYWHERE on the disk, but is usually C:\Users\user\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\modname
