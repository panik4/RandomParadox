A tab to generate, load, and edit countries.
Loading is done by dragging in an image of unique colours, which represent a country each. You can also load in a list of countries as a text file, to already define names, tags and colours, and then drag in the country image. For this, the country in the text file must have the format r;g;b;tag;name;adjective, see inputs//countryMappings.txt as an example.
You can also edit the countries and states by clicking on them in the image, I RECOMMEND EXPORTING THE MOD FIRST, as crashes can occur here, there is always the chance to edit the state and country files manually!.
You can also export the current state to the Maps//exports folder, for safekeeping.
With the Draw Borders checkbox checked, you can also distribute regions to the currently selected country.

** Do not forget that you can find the autogenerated countries map countries_no_borders.png in the "Maps" folder next to the executable, in case you want to modify them and then load them back in again.**
