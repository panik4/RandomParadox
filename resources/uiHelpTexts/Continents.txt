A visualisation of detected continents. Dragging in images to specify continents is possible, black (rgb 0,0,0) is counted as water, while every other colour is counted as its own continent. Find the generated map in the Maps folder, to use this as a base to edit continents. Continents are generated from landbodies, they are NOT random in this step.
