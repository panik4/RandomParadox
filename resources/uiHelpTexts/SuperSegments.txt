Supersegments define the areas in which segments are generated. They are by default detected from land- and waterbodies, but can be loaded. Loaded supersegments are especially useful if you want to predefine larger areas for segments, such as countries.
As Supersegments influence segment generation, and segment generation influences province generation, Supersegments define clear borders for provinces.

Loading supersegments:
Please be aware that supersegment inputs must be solid colours. This means that you don't draw in borders, but you draw areas which will be a supersegment, and in which segments will be placed, staying inside these areas.
**When loading supersegments, please be aware that the tool will notify you of errors, where supersegments cross land/sea borders. It is recommended to fix this in the input file!**
To see where it doesn't match, a debug image will be visualised in the tool, the lower image. You can also find this image in the Maps/errors folder, called supersegmentErrors.png. 
Purple means water is part of a majority land supersegment, and red means land is part of a majority sea segment.
** Do not forget that you can find the autogenerated supersegments map in the "Maps" folder next to the executable, in case you want to modify them and then load them back in again.**
