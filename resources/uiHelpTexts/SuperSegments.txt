Supersegments define the areas in which segments are generated. They are by default detected from land- and waterbodies, but can be loaded. Loaded supersegments are especially useful if you want to predefine larger areas for segments, such as countries.
As Supersegments influence segment generation, and segment generation influences province generation, Supersegments define clear borders for provinces.
