Land Input:

This tab gives the option to input either a simple image for a fully automatic heightmap generation from that input, or enabling the Classify Land Input option, dragging in an image and setting which input colour is supposed to be more or less mountainous. 
**In general, it is recommended to spend some time preparing your input images, it is easier to add detail now than later in the generated mod.**
Heightmap Generation from Simple Input:
Instead of generating a land mass from a heightmap, you may also derive a heightmap from a given land mass. For this, drag in an image. The tool will then automatically try to derive what land is and what is an ocean. If in doubt, try to stick to the colours which are otherwise generated, dark blue or black is considered water.
Heightmap Generation from Complex Input:
This extends the Simple Input case. By checking the Classify Land Input box, you enable this feature. Now, when dragging in an image, you can afterwards analyse an image and label every single colour to a land type.
Make sure you have a good image without washed up borders, e.g. don't draw an image with a brush, but use a pencil. You might otherwise get far too many colours to label, this would be tedious.

	- See the example image, you can see how a multi colour mountain chain can have SMOOTH transitions and actually look nice, if you add multiple colours and make use of all the colours for lowhills, hills, mountains, and peaks. JUST using mountains next to plains will make for a very steep transition, which will simply not look as nice.
	- In this tab, you ONLY label the input, then proceed to the heightmap tab for the generation. Always click Analyse after labeling terrain, only then is it applied for the heightmap generation!
	- See the image on the left to see how you generate from this labeled terrain in the heightmap tab.
	- You can autogenerate land from a simple shape first, and then find the map "elevationTypes.png" in the "Maps" folder next to the executable, modify those and load them back in
