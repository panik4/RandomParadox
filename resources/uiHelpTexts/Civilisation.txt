Civilisation: Here you can generate and edit development and population in multiple sub-tabs|
	- Development: Affects industrialisation and cities. Generate randomly, or load an image.
	- Population: Affects population amount and city size. Generate randomly, or load an image.
	- Locations: Affects world map look and scenario modules make use of this data.
** Do not forget that you can find the autogenerated development and population map in the "Maps" folder next to the executable, in case you want to modify them and then load them back in again.**
